# Provision-and-manage-a-basic-infrastructure-using-AWS-CloudFormation
This repository contains an AWS CloudFormation template and associated resources for creating a simple development environment. The project focuses on modifying an AWS CloudFormation template to set up an Apache web server with HTTP access, hosted in a dedicated VPC with a single public subnet and a small Amazon EC2 instance. 
The project involves:
   1. Using AWS Cloud9 to modify an existing CloudFormation template.
   2. Deploying a stack using the AWS CLI and AWS Management Console.
   3. Detecting drift in the stack after manual modifications.
   4. Updating the stack using CloudFormation's change set functionality.
