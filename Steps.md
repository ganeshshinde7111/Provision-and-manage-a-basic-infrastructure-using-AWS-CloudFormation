## Step 1: Connect to the AWS Cloud9 IDE
In this step, we connect to the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE).

**1.1: Explore the Cloud9 Interface.**
- **Editor:** The top pane to the right is the editor. The editor is where we can do things such as write code, run terminal sessions, and change IDE settings. It is currently displaying the AWS Cloud9 Welcome Screen.
- **File Tree:** The left pane is the file tree. It shows a list of all files that are currently available and open in the editor.


**1.2: Verify that the AWS CLI is installed in the Cloud9 Environment.**
- To verify the AWS CLI is installed and to display its version, run the following command in a terminal window:
        aws --version
